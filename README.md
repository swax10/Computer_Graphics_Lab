# Computer Graphics (CG) Lab Code

As there is no adequate code available for computer graphics in C language, this repository contains a bash script for practical exercises for the Computer Graphics course in MU Engineering SEM III. This repository's primary goal is to give teachers and students a one stop resource for referencing and studying.

## Installation Requirements

To setup the required environment, you need to install certain packages. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get install opengl* freeglut*
sudo apt-get install g++
```

These commands will install the necessary OpenGL libraries and the g++ compiler on your system.

## Permission
To run this bash script
Give permission
```bash
chmod 777 ./m.sh
```
