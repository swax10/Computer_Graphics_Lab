## Prerequisite: 
C Programming Language.

## Lab Objectives:
| S.No | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Understand the need of developing graphics application |
| 2 | Learn algorithmic development of graphics primitives like line, circle, polygon etc. |
| 3 | Learn the representation and transformation of graphical images and pictures |

## Lab Outcomes: At the end of the course, the students should be able to </br>
| S.No | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Implement various output and filled area primitive algorithms |
| 2 | Apply transformation, projection and clipping algorithms on graphical objects. |
| 3 | Perform curve and fractal generation methods. |
| 4 | Develop a Graphical application/Animation based on learned concept |

## Content:
Scan conversions: lines, circles, ellipses. Filling algorithms, clipping algorithms. 2D and 3D
transformation Curves Visible surface determination. Simple animations Application of these
through exercises in C/C++

## Term Work:
| S.No | Task |
|---|---|
| 1 | Term work should consist of 10 experiments. |
| 2 | Journal must include at least 2 assignments. |
| 3 | Mini Project to perform using C /C++/Java/OpenGL/Blender/ any other tool (2/3 students per. group). Possible Ideas: Animation using multiple objects, Game development, Graphics editor: Like Paint brush, Text editor etc. |
| 4 | The final certification and acceptance of term work ensures that satisfactory performance of laboratory work and minimum passing marks in term work. |
